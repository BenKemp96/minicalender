#PHP MINI Calender

##completely built within [the MINI framework made by Panique](https://github.com/panique/mini)

This PHP Calender was built to learn working with frameworks.
It was an assignment from my school to see if the class had gained enough knowledge to go on internship.
The Calender was origionally not meant to be made in a framework but due to time constraints it was a good way to hit two birds with one stone.
